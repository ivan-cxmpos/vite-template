## Getting Started

You can use this template to start a new project in two ways.

### Recommended: Use as a GitHub Template

This is the easiest way to start. It creates a new repository under your account with the same code and structure, but without the commit history.

1.  Click the **"Use this template"** button located at the top of the repository page.
2.  Give your new repository a name and click **"Create repository from template"**.
3.  Clone your new repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-new-repo.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-new-repo.git)
    ```
4.  Navigate into your project directory and install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd your-new-repo
    npm install
    ```
5.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Alternative: Use `degit`

If you prefer to use the command line without creating a new repository on GitHub first, you can use `degit`.

```bash
# Creates a new project in the "my-new-project" folder
npx degit ivan-cxmpos/vite-template my-new-project

# Navigate into your project and install dependencies
cd my-new-project
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
